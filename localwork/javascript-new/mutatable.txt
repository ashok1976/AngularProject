What will be the output of the above line of code?
"1"+2+3 = ? And 1+2+"3" = ? OutPut Will Be?
Answers:-
As you know in JavaScript, when the “first character” is a “string” the remaining characters will be converted into a “single string” that means the output of “1”+2+3 will be 123.
If the “string” is at the end the initial characters will perform normal mathematical functions before converting into a “string”, that means the output of 1+2+“3” will be 33.
 
What is function overloading in JavaScript?

There is no real function overloading in JavaScript and it allows to pass any number of parameters of any type.
 function sum(a, b) {
    alert(a + b);
}

function sum(c) {
    alert(c);
}
 
sum(3);//The output is 3.
sum(2, 4);//The output is 2.
 
 Mutable object - The object is subject to be changed/altered.
 
Immutable object - The object cannot be changed once created.
 
 
 function mutation(originalArray) {
    // directly mutating/modifying the original array
    originalArray[0] = "new value";
    return originalArray;
  }

  var array = ["some value", "another value"];
  alert("Return from mutation " + mutation(array));
  alert("Array: " + array + " (original array has been altered).");
  
  
  

function immutable(originalArray) {
    // Instead of mutating/modifying the original array,
    // we first make a copy of the original array
    // In this way, the original array stay unchanged.
    var newArray = [...originalArray];
    newArray[0] = "new value";
    return newArray;
  }

  var array = ["some value", "another value"];
  alert("Return from immutable " + immutable(array));
  alert("Array: " + array + " (original array stay unchanged).");
